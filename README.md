# Python Decompositions: PCA and More
Overview
This repository provides Python implementations and examples of various decomposition techniques, with a focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its applications. Decomposition methods are powerful tools in data analysis and machine learning for reducing dimensionality, extracting important features, and gaining insights into complex datasets.

Contents
PCA: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis algorithm using Python.
Examples: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of PCA on different datasets.
Other Decompositions: Additional decomposition techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and more.
Utilities: Helper functions and utilities for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation.
